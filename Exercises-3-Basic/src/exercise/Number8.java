//Write a Java program to find the duplicate value of an array of string values.
//You can assume that there is only one duplicate value.
//Example,
//Input: An array of integers ["alisa" , "yevgeny" , "alisa", "naruto"].
//Output: "alisa", because "alisa" is a duplicate value, meaning it appears more than once in the array.
